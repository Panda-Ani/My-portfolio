          <h3>Competitive Programming</h3>
          <p>
            Well! I think my programming journey might have started pretty late, nevertheless. 
            I am glad that I came to know about it. So, my journey began in the second semester of the first year of my college.
            And suddenly, I took a liking to it. Mainly, Competitive programming, as I like 
            promblem solving from my childhood days.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, I love Competitive programming. But it felt like it was lacking something. Don't you think the same?
            Yes, you got it right. The actual life implementation, after I enjoyed Competitive programming, I continued my
            journey and found out its application. And it was thrilling after getting the code to work after several hours of 
            debugging and when the program works as it is supposed to work is the most satisfying feeling.

          <h3>Extracurricular activities</h3>
          <p>
            Being a curious person, I participate in many activities, which range in the field of Social and Cultural activities
            to Sports. So, at present, I am on the basketball team of my hall in IIT Kharagpur and currently learning Indian
            Classical Vocals apart from these activities, I like going to the gym and being regular in my activities.
